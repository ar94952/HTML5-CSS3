   I loved the buttery taste of the crust which complements the apples very nicely.

   Nothing special. I like the crust, but there was a little too much of it for my taste, 
   and I liked the filling but there was too little of it. I thought the 
   crunchy apples combined with the sliced almonds detracted from the overall flavor.

   Delicious!! I recommend microwaving the apples for 3 minutes before baking,
   to soften them. Great dessert - I'll be making it again for the holidays.
