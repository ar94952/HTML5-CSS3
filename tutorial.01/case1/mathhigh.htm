<h1>Leonhard Euler (1707-1783)</h1>

<p>
The greatest mathematician of the eighteenth century, <strong>Leonhard Euler</strong> was
born in Basel, Switzerland. There, he studied under another giant of
mathematics, <strong>Jean Bernoulli</strong>. In 1731 Euler became a professor of physics
and mathematics at St. Petersburg Academy of Sciences. Euler was the most
prolific mathematician of all time, publishing over <em>800 different books</em> and
papers. His influence was felt in physics and astronomy as well.
</p>

<p>
He is perhaps best known for his research into mathematical analysis. Euler's
work, <cite>Introductio in analysin
infinitorum (1748)</cite>, remained a standard textbook in the field for
well over a century. For the princess of Anhalt-Dessau he wrote
<cite>Lettres &agrave; une princesse d'Allemagne</cite> (1768-1772), giving a clear
non-technical outline of the main physical theories of the
time.
</p>

<p>
One can hardly write a mathematical equation without copying Euler.
Notations still in use today, such as <var>e</var> and &pi;, were introduced
in Euler's writings. Leonhard Euler died in 1783, leaving behind
a legacy perhaps unmatched, and certainly unsurpassed, in the annals
of mathematics.

  <h1>The Most Beautiful Theorem?</h1>
<p>
Euler's Equation
</p>
<p>
cos(<var>x</var>) + <var>i</var>sin(<var>x</var>) = <var>e</var> (<var><sup>ix</sup></var>)
</p>
<p>
demonstrates the relationship between algebra, complex analysis,
and trigonometry. From this equation, it's easy to derive
the identity
</p>
<p>
<var>e</var>(<sup>&pi; <var>i</var></sup>) + 1 = 0
</p>
<p>
which relates the fundamental constants: 0, 1, &pi;, <var>e</var>, and <var>i</var> in
a single beautiful and elegant statement. A poll of readers
conducted by <cite>The Mathematical Intelligencer</cite> magazine named
Euler's Identity as the
most beautiful theorem in the history of mathematics.
