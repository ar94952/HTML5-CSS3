         <p>
            This year Sunny Acres becomes Wintery Acres as we institute 
            our first Holidays on the Farm. Join us on weekends from 
            November 23 through January 5 for holiday cheer and festivities.
         </p>
         <p>The Sunny Acres Farm Shop will be decked out in bright and 
            colorful holiday decorations with special prices on garlands, 
            tinsel, ornaments, and wreaths. Be sure to sample our homemade 
            egg nog and bring some home for your family.
         </p>
         <p>The trails and hills around Sunny Acres will be alive with fun 
            and games. Come join us for sleigh rides or zoom down our 
            awesome sledding hill (weather permitting). Sunny Acres is 
            adjacent to Dawson Park, which has a vast network of cross 
            country ski trails for every level of skier.
         </p>
         <p>We've even decorated our barn for the holidays. Come visit 
            Santa's stables, where you might even see a few reindeer--perhaps
            even one with a red nose!
         </p>
