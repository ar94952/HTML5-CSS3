            There's always something happening at Sunny Acres. 
            With the coming of fall, we're gearing up for our big 
            AutumnFest and Farm Show. If you haven't visited our famous 
            <a href="maze.htm">Corn Maze</a>,
            be sure to do so before it gets torn down on November 5. This year's 
            maze is bigger and better than ever.
         </p>

         <p>Farms can be educational and Sunny Acres is no exception. Schools and 
            home-schooling parents, spend an afternoon with us at our 
            <a href="petting.htm">Petting Barn</a>.
            We have over 100 friendly farm animals in a clean environment. Kids 
            can bottle feed the baby goats, lambs, and calves while they learn about 
            nature and the farming life. Please call ahead for large school groups.
         </p>

         <p>When the sun goes down this time of year, we're all looking for a good fright.
            Sunny Acres provides that too with another year of the 
            <a href="haunted.htm">Haunted Maze</a>.
            Please plan on joining us during weekends in October or on Halloween for our
            big Halloween Festival.
         </p>

         <p>Of course, Sunny Acres is, above all, a <em>farm</em>. Our 
            <a href="produce.htm">Farm Shop</a> 
            is always open with reasonable prices on great produce. Save even more money 
            by picking your own fruits and vegetables from our orchards and gardens.
         </p>

         <p class="closing">We all hope to see you soon, down on the farm.<br />
